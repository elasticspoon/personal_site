## TLDR

Assuming a repo `main_repo/whatever` and your fork `forked_repo/whatever`.

```sh
git clone git@main_repo/whatever.git
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin git@forked_repo/whatever.git
```

## Setting Up A Forked Repo for Easy Contributions

Have you ever contributed to an open source project? The typical process
is as follows:

- Fork the repo
- `git clone` the fork
- make changes against the branch and push them up
- open a PR against the main repo

Generally, this is fine. However, on faster moving projects it
quickly becomes a pain keep your fork in sync with upstream changes.
The only way I am familiar to get those updates is via the "Sync Fork"
button on the page of the forked repo. But doing to Github every time
is a pain.

Fear not there is another (IMO better) way.

- clone the main repo `git clone git@main_repo/whatever.git`
- rename origin to upstream `git remote rename origin upstream`
- fork it on github (ex: `my_repo/whatever.git`)
- add new origin which is fork `git remote add origin git@my_repo/whatever.git`

Now you can make changes as usual, by pushing branches up to your fork and opening
PRs. However, when you pull main it will pull changes from the original repo
**not** your fork! (Pushing to main will also
push to the main repo but don't do that).

Ruby can match string against other strings or regular expressions using `=~`, `match` and `match?`. They all do slightly different things.

```ruby interactive=true,editor=basic
p "teapot".match /pot/
# => <MatchData "pot">
p "teapot".match? /pot/
# => true
p "teapot" =~ /pot/
# => 3 (offset of match start)
```

But did you know that you can obtain the same results swapping the sides of the String and Regex:

```ruby interactive=true,editor=basic
p /pot/.match "teapot"
# => <MatchData "pot">
p /pot/.match? "teapot"
# => true
p /pot/ =~ "teapot"
# => 3 (offset of match start)
```

Since all 3 methods are defined on both `String` and `Regex` this works!

There is also an additional Regex matcher I just found out about: `!~`. Not match.
Despite the syntax it acts more similar to `!match?` than what I expected from `=~`.

```ruby interactive=true,editor=basic
p !("teapot".match? /kettle/)
# => true
p !("teapot".match? /pot/)
# => false
p !("teapot" =~ /kettle/)
# => true
p !("teapot" =~ /pot/)
# => false
p "teapot" !~ /kettle/
# => true
p "teapot" !~ /pot/
# => false
```

I would have expected `"teapot" !~ /pot/` to not return a boolean but it acts exactly like `!=~`.

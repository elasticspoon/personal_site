  review: "Very enjoyable and well-acted movie. While it is a mystery crime drama, I think the exploration of the lead actress and the family dynamics is the most interesting part of the movie. Sandra huller was phenomenal in this movie. I also really enjoyed the sound design and music."

  rating: 3.5
  review: "This movie is about two characters from Hamlet. Frankly, at this point I barely remember Hamlet. However, the acting of Gary Oldman, Tim Roth and Richard Dreyfus was enough for me to enjoy the movie. I am unsure if the movie form gains anything over it being a play but I am unlikely to see a play so I enjoyed the movie."

  review: "The movie had some very strong moments. But overall it was a huge disappointment. I found nothing scary about the movie and the only reason I finished it was because the reviews had me waiting for something more. I wonder if the dialogue was actually accurate to the time period. I also found the Christian themes of the movie to be lost on me."

  rating: 3.5
  review: "This was a pretty long movie but it managed to hold my attention pretty much the entire time. Both Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are great in it. It does a pretty good job showing the villainy of the tobacco industry. I kind of wish the tobacco companies featured a bit more directly, but at the same time I can understand that that might have been a directorial choice. I also wish there was a bit more epilogue to the movie. Since it is a good bit historical, I would have liked to know whether this whistle-blowing actually had an effect."

The movie is about their journey as they try to reconcile their longing to be more similar to the other in contrast to their natures. The movie is slow and beautifully shot. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible with how much he manages to convey using solely his posture and expressions."

  rating: 1
  review: While some scenes in the movie are certainly gruesome and disturbing, I find it hard to call The Exorcist a scary movie. The movie suffers from providing too much background information and focusing too much on the buildup of various characters. It creates more questions that it answers and the overall ending feels unsatisfying.

  review: First of all this movie is no way a comedy. It is a very matter of fact take on a pretty bleak story in post WWII Yugoslavia. Unfortunately the quality of the movie recording was so poor I could hardly see some scenes. I also lacked but historical context to understand events in the movie. I would give this one another shot with a better quality recording.

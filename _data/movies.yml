  title: Zodiac
  subtitle: There is more than one way to lose your life to a killer.
  rating: 4
  review: Enjoyable plot-driven movie about the Zodiac killer. Well acted. **Incredibly** well shot, the way the director manages to create tension in the scenes without the need for dialogue is amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as always.

  title: All Quiet on the Western Front
  rating: 3
  review: Interesting character perspective on WWI. The volume of combat action lessened the impact of what should have been a character driven movie. Having read other Remarque books the plot arc felt very predicatable.

  rating: 3
  review: A group of rich friends attempt to have a dinner party while ignoring the increasingly bizarre mishaps occuring around them. Bizarre is probably the best way to describe this movie. It was funny and captivating but very hard to follow. The movies confusing structure makes it very hard to understand on first watch but it definitely warrants a rewatch.

  title: Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn
  review: "Warning this movie is very explicit, it literally starts with a home sex video. The consequences of the video leaking are the general plot of the movie. However, the movie is very much more of a biopic about Romania. It is abstract, nerve-wracking at times but very enjoyable. It is a good movie but I find it hard to recommend."

  review: First of all this movie is no way a comedy. It is a very matter of fact take on a pretty bleak story in post WWII Yugoslavia. Unfortunately the quality of the movie recording was so poor I could hardly see some scenes. I also lacked but historical context to understand events in the movie. I would give this one another shot with a better quality recording.

  subtitle: There are no clean getaways
  rating: 4.5
  director: Joel and Ethan Coen
  year: 2007
  review: Javier Bardem is terrifying in this movie. Not a single bad acting performance. The movie is gritty and violent. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

  title: Leon The Professional
  rating: 0
  director: Luc Besson
  year: 1994
  review: I found nothing redeeming about this movie. I felt uncomfortable about the potential love? between the two characters due to the age gap. I found the idea of training montage to be too cringe to watch.

  title: Lars and the Real Girl
  subtitle: The search for true love begins outside the box
  rating: 4.5
  director: Craig Gillespie
  year: 2007
  review: I did not realize how good of an actor Ryan Gosling was until I saw this movie. In this movie he plays Lars, a guy with some severe social issues that ends up falling in love with a sex doll. Somehow despite how crazy the premise sounds there is nothing cringy at all. It's a very positive a charming movie.

  review: When police cannot catch a child murdering criminal, other criminals come together to catch them. Despite the seemingly interesting the movie is unbearably slow and boring.

  title: One Hundred Years of Solitude
  rating: 5
  review: Just wow. This is such a weird, fantastical and atmospheric book. It manages
    to build a complete world and atmosphere is so few words. One of the best books
    I have read.

  review: Basically, Agile but at a company level. It talks about experiments and

  review: Overall, a very comprehensive book. I wish the example went into more details
    about implementation. I have a ton of ideas from it but a lot of them lacked enough
    detail for me to actually implement them.

  review: I thought this book was a great read. It introduced a lot of patterns that
    make sense to me. It was opinionated that I felt like I could disagree with it
    but try the suggestions to see how they would work out.

  review: This book is incredibly pro free market. I found it to be interesting, but
    a lot of the ideas to be very challenging to accept. It certainly made me interested
    in economic theory simply for the sake of being able to figure out if I can disprove
    what the author was saying. And also some of the authors opinions seemed a little
    bit silly.

  title: How To Be an Antiracist
  rating: 0
  review: Not that long ago I read 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat'. It is a cookbook where
    the author opens with a fairly extended section of personal anecdotes and some
    of the science behind cooking. The science isn't particularly well cited but I
    believe what is being said because the author builds up trust in themselves as
    an expert. </br>'How to be an Antiracist' is in my opinion a terrible book not
    because of any ideas in it but because the author does not convey anything in
    a convincing way. The citations are scant and not particularly authoritative.
    I don't consider the New York times or a book by someone to be authoritative sources
    on sociopolitical ideas. As in, they can be secondary sources, they could support
    ideas, but I expect empirical studies to form the foundation of the arguments.
    </br>There was a point in the book where the income disparity between immigrant
    blacks and African Americans is brought up. My initial stance was that the reason
    for the disparity was probably self-selection among the immigrants. However, the
    author argues that same idea so poorly that I became less convinced of myself.
    </br>The author's life story is the thread that ties the book together. However,
    some of the anecdotes are absolutely meaningless. They should not have been in
    this book. </br>Anyone that reads a book with this title is already self-selecting,
    already going to be a group of people open to those ideas. The fact that I can
    take nothing away from this book means that it is a complete failure.

  subtitle: Essays on Software Engineering
  rating: 2
  review: 'It certainly an interesting book for my historical perspective. Surprisingly
    many of the core ideas still apply, the difficulties imposed by communication,
    the absence of a silver bullet and others. A lot of the book also covers technical
    details relevant to the time it was written: the 1970s. Those parts are lost on
    me. Overall, I think you could get the same ideas in a more modern book with significantly
    more relevant examples.'

  title: Behave

  rating: 4
  review: A very detailed and far-reaching book by Robert Sapolsky. He starts with
    a single action and discusses what caused it. Starting at neuron impulses moving
    backwards to hormones and even further to evolution. It's slow, technical but
    it covers so much. I probably understood 40% of the book on my first reading and
    I felt like I gained a ton. I found some parts specifically the societal ones
    to be a bit less interesting. But the book ends on a very powerful note.

  rating: 2
  review: Some portions of the book are definitely interesting. I was a fan of some
    of the exercises. The amount of group exercises the book calls for makes it seem
    a bit classroom oriented. I didn't hate the book but I thought it fell a bit short
    on bringing new things to the table. I felt like there was basically only one
    chapter that actually directly dealt with techniques to defeat conceptual blocks.

  review: 'Overall, the book is fine and interesting. It is the story of Richard Thaler
    and his role in developing behavioral economics as a field of study. Unfortunately,
    the content has a lot of overlap with Thinking: Fast and Slow. Some of the other
    interesting stuff is passed over because it is in his other book Nudge. I did
    not glean much from this book, but some one that hasn''t read Thinking: Fast and
    Slow would get a lot.'

  title: The Javascript Language

  rating: 4
  review: Prior to reading this book I had used a ton of JavaScript for software development
    but I had never learned it per se. It was similar enough to ruby or python and
    I had seen a ton so I had no issues writing JavaScript. But I never really understood
    the internals of the language. This book does a phenomenal job explaining those
    internals. It seems to be very up-to-date. I am a big fan of the tasks associated
    with many of the chapters. I would highly recommend this as an introduction to
    Javascript.

    this and following along.

  title: The Design of Everyday Things
  rating: 3
  review: The book was an interesting read with a decent amount of new information
    that I took away from it. However, given that it was a fairly technical non-fiction
    book, I really wish it had more sources for the information. I would have really
    enjoyed if there was more information about actual studies that got ran on design
    choices. That said, there's a surprisingly large amount in common between the
    process of design and software development.

  rating: 1
  review: Maybe it's because I read this book so soon after reading the first one,
    but I found the unicorn project very lacking compared to the Phoenix project.
    Because they share a timeline much of the plot is already known if you've read
    the first book. Well, the first book was a struggle of man versus technical debt,
    man versus poor practices. Practices this one had a lot of the same themes but
    also significantly more man versus man. I just didn't find those parts. Interesting.
    I also found the preachy bits much more common and bothersome in this book.

  rating: 4
  review: This was a super enjoyable book. It did a great job, essentially turning
    a DevOps playbook into a engaging and cohesive story. It was very fun to think
    about the problems being encountered and contemplate my own solutions. Then read
    about the book solutions. Unfortunately the book does get almost preachy at times,
    which makes sense because it is supposed to convey best practices. Although it
    kind of misses the mark as both a fiction and non-fiction book, it is still very
    enjoyable.

    with a discussion of the secretary problem. The problem goes: your interviewing
    people for a position, if you accept the person, you can interview no more. If
    you reject the person, you will never get a chance to hire them. How many people
    do you interview before making a selection? There is a concrete number at which
    you should make a decision. Read the book to find out what it is.'

Hi, I'm Yuri, a software developer from Silver Spring, Maryland. I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for problem solving and learning new technologies. I'm currently working freelance and looking for new opportunities.

I am a strong believer in the importance of understanding the fundamentals of a technology before using it. Although I have done the majority of my work in Ruby on Rails, I primarily stick to the web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I have found that my understanding of these technologies has helped me learn new frameworks and languages more quickly.

In my admittedly limited experience, I have found that the best way for me to learn is to teach. Be it when I was a teaching assistant at University of Maryland or a tutor for their computer science department, I have found that until you can teach a topic you don't really understand it. I try to continue this practice by writing blog posts about topics I find interesting.

I hope you find this compelling and if you do I would love to hear from you!
